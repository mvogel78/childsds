Description: Calculation of standard deviation scores adduced from different
    growth standards (WHO, UK, Germany, Italy, China, etc). Therefore, the calculation of SDS-values
    for different measures like BMI, weight, height, head circumference, different
    ratios, etc. are easy to carry out. Also, references for laboratory values in
    children are available: serum lipids, iron-related blood parameters. In the
    new version, there are also functions combining the gamlss lms() function with
    resampling methods for using with repeated measurements and family dependencies.
