Title: Data and Methods Around Reference Values in Pediatrics
Version: 0.6.7
Authors@R: person("Mandy", "Vogel", email = "mandy.vogel@googlemail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Calculation of standard deviation scores adduced from different
    growth standards (WHO, UK, Germany, Italy, China, etc). Therefore, the calculation of SDS-values
    for different measures like BMI, weight, height, head circumference, different
    ratios, etc. are easy to carry out. Also, references for laboratory values in
    children are available: serum lipids, iron-related blood parameters. In the
    new version, there are also functions combining the lms() function from package 'gamlss' with
    resampling methods for using with repeated measurements and family dependencies. A searchable list
    of items can be found here: <https://github.com/mvogel78/childsds/wiki>.
