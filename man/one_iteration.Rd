\usage{
one_iteration(data.list, prop.fam = 0.75, prop.subject = 1, age.min = 0,
  age.max = 18, age.int = 1/12, dist = "BCCGo", sigma.df = 3,
  nu.df = 2, mu.df = 4, tau.df = 2, verbose = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.list}{list of dataframes as returned by prepare_data}

\item{prop.fam}{proportion of families to be sampled}

\item{prop.subject}{proportion of subject to be sampled}

\item{age.min}{lower bound of age}

\item{age.max}{upper bound of age}

\item{age.int}{stepwidth of the age variable}

\item{dist}{distribution used for the fitting process, has to be one of BCCGo, BCPEo, BCTo as they are accepted by lms()}

\item{sigma.df}{degree of freedem spread parameter}

\item{nu.df}{degree of freedem skewness parameter}

\item{mu.df}{degree of freedem location parameter}

\item{tau.df}{degree of freedem kurtosis parameter}

\item{verbose}{whether or not information about sampling will be printed during while iterate}
}
\value{
list of lists each containing a dataframe of the fitted lms parameter at the given age points and the fitted model
}
\description{
one iteration
}
\details{
function samples families then measurements and fits the model
the function is called inside \code{\link{do_iterations}} and may not called directly
